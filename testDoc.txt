Need to test the following scenarios:

1. projects needs to be verified against REST call.
2. verify sort functionality on projects view.
3. verify filter on projects view, make sure the count display at the bottom page matches.
4. click on project name which should take user to the commit page for the project.
5. commit page should list all the commits.
6. verify sort and filter on commits page.
7. Back button '<' at the top of the page should take user back to the project list view.
